# java-cli-maven-sybase-pivot

## Description
Creates a small database table
called `dog`. This table, `dog`, has been normalized to 3NF.
Two new tables have been added, `breedLookup` and `colorLookup`.
Creates a new table `dog_expanded` that joins
`dog`, `breedLookup` and `colorLookup`. Added clustered indexes on
`dog`.breedId and `dog`.colorId and a non-clustered index for
`dog_expanded`.id. Turned `dog_expanded` into a view with an
implicit index on `dog_expanded`.id. Using a case statement with the aggregate function
COUNT, create a new view `breed_count`.
